# 28 GHz Flicker: A Dimensional Conductivity Hum

Welcome to the wild ride of "Dimensional Flicker at 28 GHz: A Universal Conductivity Hum in Graphene and Beyond." This repo holds a paper and simulation that predict a 28 GHz resonance—pulsed via ESR, caught by STM, screaming through FFT—across graphene, MoS₂, Bi₂Se₃, and more. Currents spike 2-20 nA, a dimensional chaos of space, time, and spins. Over 20 years distilled into this hum—now it’s yours to prove.

## What’s Inside
- **flicker_28ghz.pdf**: The paper—theory, sims, and a call to test.
- **flicker_28ghz.html**: Web version with the STM graph live.
- **stm_flicker.png**: Simulated STM current—graphene hums red (2-4 nA), chaos roars black (up to 20 nA).

## The Hum
28 GHz flips electrons wild—graphene’s just the start. MoS₂ flares, superconductors whisper, all tied to a universal SoF (system of function). Check the graph—it’s cool, it’s crazy, it’s untested.

## Test It
Got cryo-STM, 1-5 T, and 28 GHz pulses? Run it—5-10 ps bursts, watch the flicker, FFT the hum. Co-authorship’s on the table if it sings.
